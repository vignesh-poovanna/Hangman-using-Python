# Hangman-using-Python
This is my first Python project, a command-line Hangman game. It picks a random word from 200 unique options, and players must guess letters before attempts run out. There are three levels: easy (15 attempts), medium (12), and hard (10). The game shows progress, gives feedback, and taught me Python basics like loops, lists, and input.
